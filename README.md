# Contact `imgg`
In very extreme cases the communication between you and me might be censored, interceptted, or limited. Below are alternative ways to communicate with me via unnormal communication medium and/or encoding methods.

> This repo will be archived and the master branch will be locked to minimize the effect that an intruder may bring

### Contact with...
- [Issues of this repository](https://github.com/GalvinGao/contact/issues) (you may want to use the GPG public key provided below to encrypt your message before you create a new issue)
- Twitter: [@GalvinGaoLucky](https://twitter.com/GalvinGaoLucky)
- Email (in my profile page)
- ...other methods you knowledged and confirmed that it is me, physically and mentally...

### Before sending your message
- Use the GPG public key to encrypt your message provided here: `https://github.com/GalvinGao/contact/blob/master/imgg.gpg.asc` (be sure to check the URL to be exactly what you expect, and be sure to check the last commit date - it should be **signed** and commit at the time you would expect)
- If you want my reply to also be encrypted then you should **attach your public key as either an attachment or, if not applicable, a chunk of text**. If you've reached the character of one chunk of your text then you may send them in different chunks, but please make sure you **always state the fingerprint of your public key with your message, IN ONE CHUNK** in order to maximize the security.

### After all...
- Hopefully this day will never come for a Chinese citizen, but it might. Be aware.
